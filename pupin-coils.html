        <h1>Pupin coils</h1>
        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering
          work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven
          years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
          Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of
          it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been
          challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which
          was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and
          especially submarine ones.</p>
